The prize money will be separate for the winners of these two categories.\n\nGoals\n\n- The main goal of participating bot is to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal.\n- The ball is to be taken across the field only by pushing. It cannot be clamped or lifted in the air, and at no point in time should the ball be covered by all sides by the participant’s bot or any part of it.\n- Dribbling mechanisms can be used; however, the ball must have at least one direction for free motion.\n- A participant’s bot is not supposed to interact directly with the opponent’s bot when it is not in possession of the ball. If one of the bots is in possession of the ball, the other can attempt to dispossess it by attacking only the ball.\n- Physical interaction between the bots in this process will be tolerated if it is judged that the attacking bot went for the ball.\n- If a bot is found to commit a foul (directly hitting/obstructing the motion of the opponent’s bot), the opponent will be given a free–shot.\n- In case of entangling of the wires, there can be a restart, with the ball placed at the point where it was before the entangling of the wires, upon the discretion of the referee.\n- Damaging the arena in any form will lead to immediate disqualification.\n- After every goal is scored, the ball would be placed back in the center circle, and each bot shall restart from their respective D-lines.\n- There shall be red regions in the four corners. If a bot pushes its opponent to that area completely, it receives points (only applicable in Round 1).\n- Own goals are taken into account.\n\nRobot Specification\n\n- High-Torque motors are allowed.\n- Maximum dimensions – 30cm × 30cm × 15cm.\n- Maximum weight of the bot - maximum 2.5 kg.\n- Planetary motors and Mecanum wheels are strictly not allowed.\n- Maximum diameter of wheels - 6cm\n- It is advised to all participants to have long wires. Stepping into the arena will fetch you negative points.\n- Violation of any above specified rule could mean direct disqualification of the team.",

Gear up for an electrifying event that will push your engineering prowess to the limits.\n\nIn this riveting competition, participants will engineer their own car-type marvels to conquer a dynamic track. The journey begins on a smooth pavement, but get ready to tackle challenges as the track throws in sandy stretches, muddy terrains, and heart-pounding inclines. The race against time and obstacles will separate the amateurs from the true engineering champions.\n\nBut wait, it doesn't end there! Prepare for strategic deductions as points are on the line for collisions with track boundaries, rollovers during daring jumps, and navigating through inclined planes. Precision is the key, and every move counts.\n\nTo spice things up, bonus points await those who can masterfully guide their cars to send balls soaring into the air, perfectly landing them inside glass bottles strategically placed along the track. It's not just a race; it's a test of skill, creativity, and strategy.\n\nAs the dust settles from the robust qualifying round, only the top 6-7 teams will advance to the ultimate showdown in the final round. Brace yourselves for heightened challenges and an intensified difficulty level in the track. The stakes are higher, the obstacles are tougher, and only the most resilient robots will emerge victorious.\n\nGet ready to witness the fusion of technology and thrill as participants push the boundaries of robotics in a race against time and obstacles. The Robotics and Car Challenge is not just an event; it's an experience that will fuel your passion for innovation and leave you craving for more. May the best machine win!\n\n[Click here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1twsClu6yIQYCeo1ovYfLGOqBY4V1FaaB?usp=drive_link) to know more about this event\n\n[Share on WhatsApp](https://wa.me/?text=Check%20out%20this%20event%3A%20HIGHWAY%20TO%20HELL%0A%0A%20Welcome%20to%20the%20adrenaline-pumping%20world%20of%20our%20Robotics%20and%20Car%20Challenge%2C%20where%20innovation%20meets%20excitement!%20Gear%20up%20for%20an%20electrifying%20event%20that%20will%20push%20your%20engineering%20prowess%20to%20the%20limits.%2CIn%20this%20riveting%20competition%2C%20participants%20will%20engineer%20their%20own%20car-type%20marvels%20to%20conquer%20a%20dynamic%20track.%20The%20journey%20begins%20on%20a%20smooth%20pavement%2C%20but%20get%20ready%20to%20tackle%20challenges%20as%20the%20track%20throws%20in%20sandy%20stretches%2C%20muddy%20terrains%2C%20and%20heart-pounding%20inclines.%20The%20race%20against%20time%20and%20obstacles%20will%20separate%20the%20amateurs%20from%20the%20true%20engineering%20champions.%2CBut%20wait%2C%20it%20doesn%27t%20end%20there!%20Prepare%20for%20strategic%20deductions%20as%20points%20are%20on%20the%20line%20for%20collisions%20with%20track%20boundaries%2C%20rollovers%20during%20daring%20jumps%2C%20and%20navigating%20through%20inclined%20planes.%20Precision%20is%20the%20key%2C%20and%20every%20move%20counts.%2CTo%20spice%20things%20up%2C%20bonus%20points%20await%20those%20who%20can%20masterfully%20guide%20their%20cars%20to%20send%20balls%20soaring%20into%20the%20air%2C%20perfectly%20landing%20them%20inside%20glass%20bottles%20strategically%20placed%20along%20the%20track.%20It%27s%20not%20just%20a%20race%3B%20it%27s%20a%20test%20of%20skill%2C%20creativity%2C%20and%20strategy.%2CAs%20the%20dust%20settles%20from%20the%20robust%20qualifying%20round%2C%20only%20the%20top%206-7%20teams%20will%20advance%20to%20the%20ultimate%20showdown%20in%20the%20final%20round.%20Brace%20yourselves%20for%20heightened%20challenges%20and%20an%20intensified%20difficulty%20level%20in%20the%20track.%20The%20stakes%20are%20higher%2C%20the%20obstacles%20are%20tougher%2C%20and%20only%20the%20most%20resilient%20robots%20will%20emerge%20victorious.%2CGet%20ready%20to%20witness%20the%20fusion%20of%20technology%20and%20thrill%20as%20participants%20push%20the%20boundaries%20of%20robotics%20in%20a%20race%20against%20time%20and%20obstacles.%20The%20Robotics%20and%20Car%20Challenge%20is%20not%20just%20an%20event%3B%20it%27s%20an%20experience%20that%20will%20fuel%20your%20passion%20for%20innovation%20and%20leave%20you%20craving%20for%20more.%20May%20the%20best%20machine%20win!%0A%0AHead%20over%20to%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fsrijanju.in%2Fevents%2Fhighway-to-hell%20for%20exploring%20it!)\n\nRegistration closed\n\n**Event Rules:**\n\nGeneral Rules\n\n- Each team can consist of a maximum of 5 members.\n- The decision of the JUSC officials is final and abiding.\n\nEvent Rules\n\n- If a participant crosses a specific obstacle in the arena, points will be given.\n- Each time the participant bot touches the boundary of the arena, points will be deducted.
