- The reel must be recorded inside Jadavpur University Salt Lake Campus, AFTER commencement of the event. In case of any doubt, raw video files may be requested.
- After it is created, participants must post the reel from the Instagram account with which the team has registered, following the rules mentioned below. The faster the reel is posted, the more time it will have to gather likes, shares, and comments.
- Recording the reel, and posting it on Instagram, must be done by the end of Day 2. The number of likes, comments, and shares on each reel will be counted at 4 PM on Day 3.

For a team named 'Red Dragon', their post may read: Srijan 2024: Reel-a-tion – Red Dragon – Joy, hope, devastation #srijan #srijan24 #reelation #jupc #montage24 #emotion #joy #sad
- @jupconline and @srijan\_ju must be invited for collaboration on the post. Failing to do so will lead to the entry not being considered during final judging.
- Minimum duration: 15 seconds
- Maximum duration: 30 seconds
- The audio applied to the reel must be consistent with the subject matter and will be considered during judging. Using trending audios with no connection to the subject matter of the reel will lead to disqualification.
