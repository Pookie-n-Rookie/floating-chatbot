**Event Description:**

Welcome to the adrenaline-pumping world of our Robotics and Car Challenge, where innovation meets excitement! Gear up for an electrifying event that will push your engineering prowess to the limits.

In this riveting competition, participants will engineer their own car-type marvels to conquer a dynamic track. The journey begins on a smooth pavement, but get ready to tackle challenges as the track throws in sandy stretches, muddy terrains, and heart-pounding inclines. The race against time and obstacles will separate the amateurs from the true engineering champions.

But wait, it doesn't end there! Prepare for strategic deductions as points are on the line for collisions with track boundaries, rollovers during daring jumps, and navigating through inclined planes. Precision is the key, and every move counts.

To spice things up, bonus points await those who can masterfully guide their cars to send balls soaring into the air, perfectly landing them inside glass bottles strategically placed along the track. It's not just a race; it's a test of skill, creativity, and strategy.

As the dust settles from the robust qualifying round, only the top 6-7 teams will advance to the ultimate showdown in the final round. Brace yourselves for heightened challenges and an intensified difficulty level in the track. The stakes are higher, the obstacles are tougher, and only the most resilient robots will emerge victorious.

Get ready to witness the fusion of technology and thrill as participants push the boundaries of robotics in a race against time and obstacles. The Robotics and Car Challenge is not just an event; it's an experience that will fuel your passion for innovation and leave you craving for more. May the best machine win!
