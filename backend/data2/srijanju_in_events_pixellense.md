**Event Description:**

It is a photography competition in which the photos will be judged on the basis of a theme which will be announced during the fest. "It is an illusion that photos are made with the camera... they are made with the eye, heart, and head.”, said the pioneer of street photography, Henri-Cartier Bresson. So do not think twice about what type of device you own, as long as it is capable of capturing images. Be it a mobile camera, a point-and-shoot, a DSLR, or a mirrorless, we want to see your unique point of view and thought process captured in a frame. This event will consist of budding photographers capturing images on a certain given topic inside the campus. The top 30 images will be selected by the judge, and will be exhibited for public voting. A combination of the judge’s score and public voting will reveal the Top 3 winners.

Create the most amazing frames and capture enthralling moments as you explore the beautiful art of photography!
