**Event Description:**

Traffic data analytics refers to the process of acquiring and analyzing information on traffic flow, such as car, pedestrian, and bicycle movements. Decisions about urban planning and transportation management can be based on data insights into traffic patterns, congestion, and potential safety risks. Traffic data analytics can help transportation planners and engineers optimise traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve road safety by leveraging cutting-edge analytical tools and methodologies. The goal of the event is to use the many data analytics tools in our engineering area to leverage our skills gained over the last four years in using these tools to derive engineering conclusions.

**Event Rules:**

- The data analysis should be measured with respect to the original dataset and can be done in any software of choice, but must be finally presented in an EXCEL file.
- The graphs/dashboarding/plots must be clearly distinguishable and aesthetically appealing.
- The approach in calculating the parameters must be logical, and if there are any assumptions in doing so, that must be clearly mentioned beforehand.
- The inferences drawn from the data analysis must be thought of in terms of improving the traffic flow parameters.
- The conclusions drawn must be insightful and justifiable in terms of the problem statement and not abstract.
