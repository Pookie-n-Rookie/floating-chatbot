**Event Rules:**

Prelims

- Each team will have 3-4 members, and they will face an 8Ã—8 matrix full of brainstorming questions.
- Each element of the matrix will have two questions; the answer to the questions will give the row address and column address of the next element.
- Guessing is not allowed or else disqualification.
- Upon solving each element, that particular team receives a key. Each key has a part of a jumbled puzzle.
- The goal is to solve the elements one by one, decipher the next location, solve that element, and in this way, collect all four keys, and unscramble the puzzle.
- The first four teams to SUBMIT THE FINAL ANSWER win, and qualify for the finale.

Finals

- Four teams qualify.
- Two teams will enter one room together.
- Look. Understand. Analyze.
- The clue lies right there, everywhere around you, be it the curtain on the floor, or the poster on the wall; they can be anywhere. Decipher the clues chronologically, and find out the number to unlock the number lock that locks you up in the room.
- The first team to earn their freedom wins!
- The questions will be logic, mathematics, and science-based, but nothing out of the blue!
