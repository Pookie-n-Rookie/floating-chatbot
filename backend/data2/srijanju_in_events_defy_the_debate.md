**Event Description:**

Defy the Debate will be a Lincoln-Douglas type Oxford Debate held in collaboration with Jadavpur University Debating Society at Srijan'24.

The Oxford-style debate format involves a debate on a predetermined statement – also called a “motion” – from two opposing perspectives.

The two sides either argue “for” or “against” the motion within a formalized structure.

The Open to Debate debate series favors the Oxford-style format because both sides have an equal opportunity to share their arguments and opinions.

This promotes intellectual diversity and curates thought-provoking discussions that inform, and sometimes sway, the audience.

So, are you ready to Reason, Retort and Resolve!!!
