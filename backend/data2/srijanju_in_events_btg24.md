**Event Description:**

The open web girder type bridge, centrally loaded and designed to support the highway surface, incorporates truss members as its basic structural components.

Using popsicles and a glue gun, these truss members are to be built by a team of minimum 2 and a maximum 4 participants to bear the design load as well as the structure's self-weight while staying within the organizers' specified parameters.


Teams will be judged on the economic sustainability, aesthetics, functionality and practical design approach of the structure. Teams have to build the model within a stipulated time constraint of approx. 3 hours, which will be tested by applying varied loads on it.


Students of all years, disciplines and educational institutions are welcomed to participate. There is no prerequisite skill besides critical thinking and creative problem solving. All the materials required for the construction of the bridge model will be provided by the organizers. The problem statement will include a detailed description of the design load and design constraints.
